this repo simply contains the last few versions of the project code for swingsmart
the FINAL versions are the two projects with the end label "COMBINED" - These two projects, for the client and server
contain all of the functionaloities described in the final design report, and combine them into one project. These two are
the project that was demonstrated to the professors during the demo session, and they are what the devices were programmed with
during rotunda day. The other files are simply added for completeness in case for some reason someone needs to see them.

The javascript display tool that we used was developed by someone else and we made small changes to it. That javascript project can
be found at the link below:
